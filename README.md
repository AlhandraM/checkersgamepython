# checkersgamepython
A group work for a checkers game.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Rules

- The game is played on an 8x8 checkered board.
- Each player starts with 12 pieces, placed on the dark squares of three rows closest to them.
- Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward, capturing their opponent's pieces by jumping over them.
- Regular pieces can only move forward diagonally one square at a time.
- If a regular piece reaches the opponent's back row, it is crowned a "king" and gains the ability to move and capture both forward and backward.
- The game ends when one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or when one player cannot make any more legal moves, resulting in a draw.

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of the following Python files:

- `checkers.py`: The main script that initializes the game, handles user input, and controls the flow of the game.
- `checkers_logic.py`: Contains the game logic, including functions for checking valid moves, updating the board, and determining the winner.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions on how to play the game and other relevant information.
